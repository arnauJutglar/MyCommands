# A set of simple commands

### Introduction
Just a set of commands I've done that create C, C++ and header templates with the specified name. The package comes with a install.sh bash script that installs them into a newly created folder MyCommands inside the user's connection directory. Its purpose is to test the creation and installation of commands rather than creating complex C programs.

### Installation
With a bash session where you downloaded the package, run:
```
bash install.sh
```
